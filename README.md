# Random_Number_Game
This a game made by C language. So, a number is predefined and you have to guess the number. The code will tell you the difference between pre-defined number and guessed number. After you successfully guessed your number, the number of guesses will appear on the terminal. Try it, it will be fun....and tell me the shorted guess of yours.
